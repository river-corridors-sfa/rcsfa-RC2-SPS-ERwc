Appling_ERtot_analysis.R,R code to process and analyze daily reach-averaged ecosystem respiration (ERtot) data originally for 356 rivers and streams as described in Appling et al. (2018b; 2018c). This code uses a subset from 208 StreamPULSE sites that has been cleaned and gap-filled (Bernhardt et al. 2022) from the Appling et al. (2018b; 2018c) dataset. This code converts these data from the original areal units (grams oxygen per meter squared per day) to volumetric units (milligrams oxygen per liter per day) for comparison with water column respiration (ERwc) data observed in the Yakima River basin (this study). The output data file is used as an R input data file to Lit_Compare_MML.R to generate descriptive statistics for ERtot and the kernel density plot in Figure 2a.,N/A,-9999,-9999,/Code
ERwc_calculation.R,R code to process sensor replicate data originally given in milligrams oxygen per liter per min to mean stream ecosystem respiration in milligrams oxygen per liter per day and temperature. It also generates Supplementary Information Figure S3.
