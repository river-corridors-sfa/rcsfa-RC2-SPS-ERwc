InstallationMethod_ID,InstallationMethod_Description
Pipe_Kit_02,Sensor is deployed inside a protective pipe kit and placed on the riverbed as close to the thalweg as possible depending on river depth and access to the shoreline.
WaterColumn_Handheld,"Handheld sensor is held below the surface of the water to equilibrate. Following equilibration, water column samples are collected by dipping the instrument below the water surface to fill the cup and then manually recording parameter values. Three replicate samples are collected one after the other at each site."
ManualChamberDark_01,"Open channel respiration was estimated by deploying triplicate 2-L dark bottle incubations for 2 hours at each site. Two liter bottles were rinsed three times with river water, submerged, filled with river water, and then capped underwater to prevent water bubbles from entering the bottles. Sensors, bottles, and boat motors were then placed in a cooler filled with fresh river water for a 20-minute equilibration period. Following the equilibration period, the bottles were emptied, refilled with river water and, while still submerged, a miniDOT Logger and a small boat motor were inserted in each of three 2-L brown Nalgene bottles. The bottles were placed in a cooler filled with fresh river water and placed in the shade in a cooler filled with fresh river water for 2 hours. The cooler was replenished with river water every 20 mins to maintain ambient river water temperature. "
TreeRope_01,Sensor deployed at the end of a short rope (2-3 ft) and hung from a tree branch as close to the sampling location as possible.
