# Site IDs have International Generic Sample Numbers (IGSNs) registered with System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR; https://www.geosamples.org/about/services#igsnregistration).  This file maps between site IDs (in the column labeled Sample_Name) and IGSNs. It conforms to the ESS-DIVE Sample ID and Metadata Reporting Format (IGSN-ESS) v1.1.0 (Damerow et al. 2020). Some information is repeated between the field metadata file and this file.,,,,,,,,,
