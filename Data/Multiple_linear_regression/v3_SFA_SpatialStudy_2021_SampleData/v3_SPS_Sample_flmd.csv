v3_SPS_Water_Sample_Data_Summary.csv,"Mean dissolved organic carbon (DOC; reported as non-purgeable organic carbon; NPOC); mean total nitrogen (TN); mean dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC); total suspended solids (TSS); ions; benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCA); compound specific stable isotopic composition of carbon (delta carbon-13/carbon-12) in benzenepentacarboxylic acid (B5CA) and benzenehexacarobyxlic acid (B6CA) from water samples. For each sampling event (e.g. SPS_0005_Water), the  values of each of the three biological replicates for a given measurement (e.g. SPS_0005_OCN-1; SPS_0005_OCN-2; SPS_0005_OCN-3) are averaged. Any replicate values that were an outlier (using distance-based outlier detection) or above/below the limit of detection are not included in the mean. The ""Mean_Missing_Reps"" column indicates if a mean does not include all three replicates using a TRUE/FALSE flag where TRUE indicates one or more replicates are missing from the mean. Some sample types only have one replicate (i.e. TSS, Ions, BPCA, and BPCA isotopes) so the data reported in this file is not an average; therefore the values for SPS_0001_Water is the same as SPS_0001_ION-1; SPS_0001_TSS-1; and SPS_0001_GRA-1 for these data types.",ESS-DIVE CSV v1; ESS-DIVE Water-Soil-Sediment Chem v1, 2021-08-30, 2021-09-15,N/A; -9999,/v3_SFA_SpatialStudy_2021_SampleData
