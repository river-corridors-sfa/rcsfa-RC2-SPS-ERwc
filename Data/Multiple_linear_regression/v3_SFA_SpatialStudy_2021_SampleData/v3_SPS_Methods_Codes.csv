Example: ""Bromide_0.00585_ppm_Below_LOD_0.026_ppm"" means that the Bromide concentration was 0.00585 milligrams_per_liter (ppm) which was below the 0.026 milligrams_per_liter (ppm) limit of detection.",N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)

The second part indicates the raw data value without any correction. The third part indicates the final corrected value. This value could be corrected based on dilution or other corrections (see the alphanumeric codes at the top of the data column for more details). A text string such as ""NPOC_Above_30_ppm_Standard|30.1_ppm_Raw_Not_Corrected|415.2_ppm_Final_Corrected"" indicates that the NPOC value is above the 30 parts per million (ppm) standard (the highest standard used); the raw value was 30.1ppm; and the corrected value (due to dilution) is 415.2ppm. The raw not corrected and final corrected values could be the same if there was no dilution or other corrections needed.
