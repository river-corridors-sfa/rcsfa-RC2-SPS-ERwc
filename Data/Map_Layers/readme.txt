To recreate the LULC map using "ERwc_LULC_Map.qgz", merge "ERwc_Mean.csv" with the field metadata that can be found at https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/view/doi%3A10.15485%2F1892052, v3_SFA_SpatialStudy_2021_SensorData.zip. The resulting file should be called "ERwc_Coords_LULC.csv" with the following column headers: Site_ID, Mean_ERwc, Mean_Temp, Latitude, Longitude. Positive Mean_ERwc values are set to 0.
